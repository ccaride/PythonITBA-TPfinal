## Description
<p align="justify">
Hi, welcome to my project! This is the Final Project of a course in Python I have taken at ITBA in 2023. The aim of the project is to allow the user get financial data from the Internet and save it in a Database so then he/she can make Reports or Graphs from them. With this App, users will be able to quickly and easily explore historic data and compare the evolution or values of different tickers at different times. I hope you enjoy and get the best out of it! Your comments or contributions will be welcome.  :chart_with_upwards_trend:
